# discord-credit-bot

## What is it?
A discord bot to keep track of feedback 'credits' - the use-case is intended for creative groups where there's a feedback loop. Kind of like a, I'll read yours if you read mine, kinda thing.

## Why?
Practice and fun mostly. Not intended for anything other than small tinkering.
